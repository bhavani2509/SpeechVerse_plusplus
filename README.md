Distributed Real-Time Voice Command Processing System
Developed SpeechVerse++, a cloud-native, distributed voice command processing architecture integrating OpenAI’s Whisper and 
Google’s FLAN-T5 within a Ray-based framework on AWS. Engineered for real-time, low-latency transcription and instruction- 
based language understanding, supporting scalable deployments on CPU and GPU-backed EC2 instances. Achieved enhanced 
transcription performance and accuracy, evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER), overcoming traditional bottlenecks like batch 
latency and single points of failure.
